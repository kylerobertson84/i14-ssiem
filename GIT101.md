# Basic Git Workflow Commands and Notes

This document outlines the Git workflow and branching strategy for our I14 - SIEMS. The workflow is designed to ensure smooth collaboration, organised code management, and stable production releases.

## Main Branches

1. **Main Branch (`main`):**
   - **Purpose:** This branch is reserved for production-ready code. It reflects the current state of the production environment.
   - **Usage:** Only merge code into `main` when it is thoroughly tested and approved for release.

2. **Development Branch (`develop`):**
   - **Purpose:** This branch is used for integrating feature development and bug fixes before they are merged into `main`.
   - **Usage:** Merge feature branches into `develop` for testing and integration purposes.

## Branch Naming Convention Guide

Use the following format for branch names:

```
<tech-stack>/<purpose>/<your-topic-name>
```

- **`<tech-stack>`**: Specifies the area of the codebase (e.g., `frontend`, `backend`, `database`).
- **`<purpose>`**: Indicates the type of work (e.g., `feature`, `hotfix`, `bugfix`, `refactor`).
- **`<your-topic-name>`**: Describes the specific feature or fix (use hyphens to separate words).

### Components Explained

1. **Tech Stack (`<tech-stack>`)**
   - Defines the part of the system the branch pertains to.
   - Examples:
     - `frontend` – for changes related to the user interface.
     - `backend` – for changes related to the server-side logic and API.
     - `database` – for changes related to database schema and queries.

2. **Purpose (`<purpose>`)**
   - Describes the nature of the work or the reason for the branch.
   - Examples:
     - `feature` – for new features or enhancements.
     - `hotfix` – for urgent fixes required to resolve critical issues.
     - `bugfix` – for addressing non-critical bugs or issues.
     - `refactor` – for changes that improve code structure without altering functionality.

3. **Topic Name (`<your-topic-name>`)**
   - A brief, descriptive name for the specific work being done.
   - Should be concise yet descriptive enough to understand the scope of the work.
   - Typically uses hyphens to separate words (e.g., `adding-alert-page`).
### Examples:
- `frontend/feature/add-alert-page`
- `backend/hotfix/fix-null-pointer-exception`
- `database/refactor/optimize-queries`

## Navigating Through Git (Common)

### 1. Creating and Managing Branches

> [!CAUTION]
> Before `Git add .` please save all your changes that you want to push and close all the files.

```bash
# Ensure you're on the latest develop branch
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Create and switch to a new feature branch
git checkout -b frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget

# Work on your feature...

# Stage changes
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add new dashboard widget with real-time updates"

# Push your branch to the remote repository
git push -u origin frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget
```
### 2. Keeping Your Branch Updated

> [!TIP]
> Before working on your branch. Best recommend to update it first!

```bash
# Fetch the latest changes from all remote branches
git fetch --all

# Checkout current branches that you have
git branch
```
```bash
# Option 1: Merge the latest develop into your feature branch
git checkout frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget
git merge origin/develop
```

```bash
# Option 2: Rebase your feature branch on top of develop
git checkout frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget
git rebase origin/develop

# Resolve any conflicts, then continue the rebase
git rebase --continue

# Force push your updated branch (only if you rebased!)
git push --force-with-lease origin frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget
```

### 3. Merging Feature Branch into `develop`

> [!WARNING]
> Only when you have <ins>FULLY DEVELOPED</ins> your branch. Everything works!!

```bash
# Ensure your feature branch is up-to-date
git checkout frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget
git pull origin frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget

# Update with the latest develop
git merge origin/develop

# Resolve any conflicts
# Run tests to ensure everything works

# Push your updated feature branch
git push origin frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget

# Create a Pull Request on your Git Website platform `base: develop` <<-- `compare: frontend/feature/new-dashboard-widget`
```
- Hop onto our Git Repo Website [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/kylerobertson84/i14-ssiem/pulls) `develop` <- your-branch-name

> [!NOTE]
> Please making sure you are merging into `develop` from <-- Your-Branch-Name!!

## Merging `develop` into `main`:
> [!CAUTION]
> <ins>**DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT TEAM MEETING**</ins>

```bash
# Ensure develop is up-to-date
git checkout develop
git pull origin develop

# Switch to main and update it
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge develop into main
git merge develop

# Push the updated main branch
git push origin main

# Consider creating a release tag
git tag -a v1.2.3 -m "Release version 1.2.3"
git push origin v1.2.3
```

#### Best Practices

- **Frequent Commits:** Commit changes frequently to save progress and make it easier to track changes.
- **Descriptive Messages:** Use clear and descriptive commit messages to understand the purpose of changes.
- **Regular Updates:** Regularly pull the latest changes from `develop` into your feature branch to minimise conflicts.
- **Code Reviews:** Always create a PR/MR for merging into `develop` and `main`, and get your code reviewed by a team member.

#### Troubleshooting

- **Merge Conflicts:** If you encounter merge conflicts, resolve them by editing the conflicting files, staging the resolved changes, and completing the merge or rebase.
