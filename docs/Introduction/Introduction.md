# Introduction

## Purpose

The purpose of this Simple Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) platform is to provide a centralized, secure solution for ingesting and analysing security event logs from diverse sources, including Windows devices, network appliances, and applications such as firewalls and SQL servers. Designed with a security-first approach, the SIEM aims to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive log data, utilizing secure storage practices and web interfaces protected by SSL/TLS encryption and adherence to OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

This SIEM enables real-time detection and correlation of potential threats based on custom rules, allowing operations analysts to triage and investigate alerts efficiently. Through its user-friendly web interface, analysts can interact with alerts and add comments during investigations. 

Containerized for ease of deployment and scalability, this SIEM empowers organizations to enhance their security posture, protect critical data, and respond swiftly to suspicious activities.

## Scope

The scope of this SIEM platform covers the entire lifecycle of security event management, from log ingestion to threat detection, alerting, and investigation. It is designed to ingest security logs from a variety of sources, including Windows-based systems and network devices. The SIEM securely stores and processes these logs to identify potential threats through rule-based correlation and generates alerts for suspicious activity.

Key functionalities include:

- Log Ingestion: Collection of security logs from Windows devices and various network appliances or applications.
- Threat Detection and Correlation: Utilizing predefined rules to identify and flag security incidents based on ingested data.
- Alerting and Investigation: A user-friendly web interface that allows administers and analysts to investigate alerts and create reports.
- Security and Compliance: Secure storage of logs, web interface with SSL/TLS encryption, and adherence to security best practices such as OWASP Top 10.
- Containerized Deployment: The platform is built as a containerized solution to ensure scalability, portability, and simplified deployment across environments.
